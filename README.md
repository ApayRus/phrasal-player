# Phrasal Player

This project is a git submodule that can be used in React projects to play and edit phrases (time intervals) with different options. It can be used in educational apps and caption/subtitle editors.

Phrasal player uses `wavesurfer.js` to:

- track current phrase while playing audio or video
- play particular phrase
- play phrases in different scenarios (e.g. with repeats, delays, as dictation)
- edit phrases (add and change time intervals)

This repo contains Phrasal Player itself (as a git submodule) and a small demo app showing how it works.
